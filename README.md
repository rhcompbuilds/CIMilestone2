# Restore A MK1 Cortina
## Introduction
Restore A Cortina is a static front-end website used to document the journey of the restoration of a MK1 Ford Cortina.
It is a blog style site that guides the viewer through the remarkable transformation of a rusted broken shell to the running drag racing beast that she is today.  
I decided to create this as a resource for restoration enthusiasts as well as a way of reminding the owner of how far his car has come since Lockdown 1.

I have designed it to be a responsive website which is simple to navigate and easy to read.
