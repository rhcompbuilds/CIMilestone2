# Create a JavaScript Game
## Breakout style game
### Initial thoughts
When I first started this project, I wanted to build a first person, racing game.  After some experimentation, the graphics and coding required weren't simple.
Based on time constraints and having a purely Javascript based game, I decided to recreate the old Breakout game.
