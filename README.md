# Breakout style game
---
## Overview
---
Breakout is a block busting game, where each level increase the challenge through increase of ball speed and more hits required to clear a level.
Each block is colour coded so that each time it is hit, the block changes colour and then eventually breaks.

Using a canvas and CSS styling on a basic HTML page, I have created a completely Java Script based version of it, that could be used on sites as a break from massive amounts of information, or just as a fun, addictive game.

Breakout, the original game was released in 1976, quickly becoming a cult classic and the basis for the creation of a multitude of similar games.

#### [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)] "The game was a worldwide commercial success. It was among the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1976 in the U.S. and Japan, and among the top three in both countries for 1977."

![wireframe of site](media/Wireframe.png "Wireframe image of the layout of the site, on 3 screen sizes")

Above is a basic wireframe design of how I wanted the website to look.  
I have organised the files into specific folders; 'css', 'javascript' & 'media' relevent to each type of file. As stated earlier, the project consists of HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Each written in their own files.  I have not used Phaser or anything else to write this code, it is of my own writing.  

### HTML

- index.html - This is the loading page and where the game, instructions and leaderboard are displayed.

### CSS
  #### css folder
- breakout.css - This is where the styling for the game was originally, and I had a separate style sheet for the HTML.  It made no sense to keep them separate, so I combined them.

### JavaScript
  #### javascript folder
- breakout.js - The functions and build of the game is in this file.  I kept it as a single file, to improve loading times.

### Media
  #### media folder
- background.jpg - One of my background choices for the site.  I found this to be too busy for the game and caused a distraction.
- background1.jpg - Another background that I found and decided would be too busy for the game.
